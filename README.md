# Cluttered_Mystery_Robo
Play as a little robot trying to clean up the factory you wake up in. Along the way uncover the mystery of how the factory got to such a state. See below for the Github page link. Note: There is a known issue with the movement of the robot. If you get stuck on a rock, rotate until you are fully facing away.
